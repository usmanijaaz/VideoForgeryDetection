This video forgery detection is carried out using Python (RESnext, CNN and LSTM).
The data of videos were requested by Google, Face Forensics. 
You can search for FaceForencsics on web and can get the dataset.
We couldn't get results because of unavailablity of GPU to train such a large dataset. We trained it on like 500-1000 videos which took 6,7 hours on google colab. 
You can try training on whole dataset if you have resources.
